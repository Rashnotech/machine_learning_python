Introduction to machine learning with python
<header>
_It all started in 1950 when an English scientist Alan turing published a seminal paper titled "Computing Machinery and Intelligence". In this groundbreaking work, Turing introduced the concept of what we now know as the Turing test. Rather than asking whether machines can think (a question he found ambiguous), Turing proposed an alternative: Can a machine convincingly imitate human behaviour in a game? This game, called the "Imitation Game", involves three participants: a computer, a human and a judge._

## Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the theory and development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that historically required human intelligence such as recognizing speech, making decisions and identifying patterns.

## What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data.

**Data**
Data can be anything from numbers and text to images and videos.

**Model**
This is a mathematical representation of the relationships between the data points.

**Learning**
This refers to the process of training the model using data.

### Machine Learning can be used for tasks

**1. Classification**
Assigning a label to an input (e.g., Identifying whether an email is spam or not).

**2. Regression**
Predicting a continuous value (e.g., predicting house prices based on features like size and location).

**3. Anomaly Detection**
Anomaly detection approaches patterns that exist within certain subsets of the data, the goal is to establish a notion of normality that describes most (say, more than 95%) of a given dataset.

**4. Clustering**
Grouping similar data points together (e.g., segmenting customers based on buying behaviour).


### Types of Machine Learning
**1. Supeverised Learning**
